# Daily Planner App
## About the Project
In this Challenge, you'll create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

Here are the requirements:
- Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persist events between refreshes of a page.
